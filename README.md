# JoeBlazor
A Simple [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com) sample project that uses shared pages/controls for both WASM and Server that auto deploys to GitHub pages each time you commit on master.

So you can develop/debug using Blazor Server (because it plays nicer with vs/vs code) but publish as a static WASM app.

App is published to https://sohojoe.github.io/JoeBlazor/
